# Pricesy---Laptop-Price-Predictor

• This machine learning project estimates the cost of a laptop based on parameters like CPU, GPU, RAM, OS, and
company.
• To prepare the data for training, exploratory data analysis, outlier removal, feature selection, one-hot encoding, and
column transformation were performed.
• The model was then trained using sklearn models, and various parameters were tweaked to analyse the scores. Finally,
calculated and analysed the r2 score and MAE using several models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest,
Decision Trees, KNN, etc.
• Finally, after final analysis and tweaking all the possible parameters, the final average accuracy of 85% was obtained.
